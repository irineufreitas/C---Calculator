# Overview

C++ has become a language of interest as I have learned of its possiblities. I have been developing and learning more how to code with C++ and creating applications has been the best method to learn and evolve as I practice the concepts from C++.

I wrote a basic command line calculator to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The creation of the application is to enhance my skills and provide me with more practice using the C++ language.

# Development Environment
VSCode was the main tool I used. Extensions such as Code Runner, C++ by Micrososft were also added to the Vscode to make the coding possible.
